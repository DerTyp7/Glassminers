## Frog
The Frog Monster is stationary with a slow attack but high range.
It blocks tight areas like tunnels and requires the player to constantly think about where they are and where they can go.

## Goblin
The Goblin is stationary with a fast attack and low range. The goblin has low health and is therefore a tiny interruption in the plans of the players, as they might have to kill the goblin before they can proceed. Sometimes however they can also make the decision to ignore the goblin if they don't require the resources.

## Slime
The Slime tries to steal items and annoy and disrupt the player. This should force the player to make decisions on whether to deal with the Slime (which takes time) or to ignore the Slime and potentially lose some items.
It also tries to break the pattern of the many stationary monsters.

## Void Eye
The Void Eye is a very dynamic monster that will only live in dark areas of the map. This monster makes the darkness a big threat to the player, and can often cause a game over.
As the darkness is now dangerous, the players are now under time pressure to keep their light sources alive. This circles back to the general idea of how the game should be played.
This also breaks the pattern of existing monsters as this monster actually chases the player and becomes an active threat. Because it can move through walls, it is also different to the existing game and therefore rounds it up nicely.

## Knight
The Knight Monster is a stationary monster that is invulnerable from one side through a shield. It has a slow, medium range attack using a lance. The attack will actually build up for a short while, giving the player time to react to an incoming attack. The attack however deals a lot of damage.
As the shield blocks the light beam, players will need to bait this knight when trying to kill it, thus creating a big, time consuming challenge for them.
