## Recipe Costs
The trader currently has a constant cost for all recipes. However we could also do a dynamic pricing model. This adaptation for the pricing model could be based on a few different things:
- The section index to increase difficulty the longer the game goes
- How often a recipe has been bought so far (or how many recipes have been bought in total)
- The [[Biomes|biome]] we are currently in
- Some randomness factor for each trader

This adaptive pricing model can make the game more interesting for the following reasons:
- Your actions (= which recipes you buy when) will now have consequences as the pricing model might change, influencing your game later on
- There might be surprise as to what the next trader's pricing model will be, which can be exciting
- The game will naturally increase in difficulty the further you get

## Recipe Availability
It might also be interesting to not offer all recipes at all traders. Instead, you could have different kinds of traders that offer different recipes.
What kind of trader spawns might be random, or it could be based on the current [[Biomes|biome]] or something...

## Benefits
The trader offers some resources for money, but it also offers some benefits. These benefits can massively impact how the game is played for a while. These effects include:
- [x] Health
- [x] Strength (increasing the mining speed)
- [ ] Fire Resistance (Allowing you to walk through lava for a while)
- [ ] Golden Apple (Additional hearts for a while that won't regenerate)
- [ ] Charme (Won't be attacked by monsters for a whlie)
- [ ] Night Vision (Ability to see monsters / resources highlighted in the dark)
