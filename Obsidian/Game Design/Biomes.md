One way of adding variety to the game, as well as making the game more challenging the longer you play, is implementing special biomes.
Every section, we decide which biome to generate. Each biome can have its own different challenge and game mechanics.
Some biomes shall also act as [[World Progression#Difficulty Gates]].

## Default Biome
This default biome will obviously be the most common one in the game.
While representing the base game mechanic, this biome will also build up the player's resources for the bigger challenges.

## Lava Lake
Here you'll have to use some rocks to build bridges. This biome will also generate enough rocks to actually get across to not be impossible to beat. However, it will take some time to mine the rocks when needed, and you also have to clear a path for the light beam.
Finally, this is the home of the [[Monsters#Frog]] monster, making your passage even more difficult as you need to plan ahead.
Since the lava lake is pretty unobstructed though, killing these monsters should be relatively easy.

## Goblin Nest
This biome will spawn a bunch of goblins. The players must now come up with the easiest and quickest way to get across, without being killed.
This should feel more like a puzzle element than some action game.

## Bedrock Bastion
This biome will take a long time to get through, as you need to figure out where the beam & emitters shall go and where the players shall go.
This biome also won't spawn any resources, meaning the players will have to rely on their savings. This acts as a gate on whether you have saved up enough.
